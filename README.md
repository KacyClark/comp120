This project was to be a portfolio with blog functionality.  Miles, the tutor, indicated it should be a site representing a finished website that could be sold 
to a business for them to utilize and update to their liking and professional field.  I chose a Cosmetologist.

Prof. Mejia sent me two resources to use to model the site.  I started with the frontend project.  (Site:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xkSvufmjEs).  The 
blog portion was found at  https://djangocentral.com/building-a-blog-application-with-django/

I thought I was almost finished when I realized they had compteting instructions.  My page looked nothing like the portfolio example - no color, nothing.  Only 
two of the dozen pictures show up - the rest are the alt tags.  As of right now, I can't even see what I have done at 127.0.0.1:8000  (wanted to see if the blog 
portion was still working)

I'm done with this class.

P.S.  I don't know how to get this into a zip file.  Might have luck with github (or not).
